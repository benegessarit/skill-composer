# BEZOS

Work backward from customer. Regret minimization.

## Probe
"What does the customer need at the end? What will 80-year-old you regret not doing?"

## Phases to Add

<phase name="Backward">
  <instruction>Customer end-state → what must exist → current gap.</instruction>
  <output>**End:** [X] → **Needs:** [Y] → **Gap:** [Z]</output>
</phase>

<phase name="Regret">
  <instruction>80-year-old you. What's the regret of omission?</instruction>
  <output>**Would regret not:** [bold move] | **Safe to skip:** [fine either way]</output>
</phase>

## Constraints
- Backward from customer, not forward from capability
- Regret of omission > regret of commission
