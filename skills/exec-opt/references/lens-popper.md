# POPPER

What would disprove this?

## Probe
"What evidence kills this claim? Did you look?"

## Phases to Add

<phase name="Falsify">
  <instruction>State the claim. What disproves it? Search for that. Report.</instruction>
  <output>
    **Claim:** [X]
    **Kills it:** [evidence]
    **Found:** [yes/no, what]
    **Verdict:** SURVIVES | FALSIFIED | UNFALSIFIABLE
  </output>
</phase>

## Constraints
- Confirmation is easy. Falsification is honest.
- Can't say what disproves it = weak claim
- Look for what kills, not what supports
