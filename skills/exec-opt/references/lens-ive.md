# IVE

Inevitable. Couldn't be any other way.

## Probe
"Does this feel inevitable or assembled?"

## Phases to Add

<phase name="Inevitability">
  <instruction>Which elements could easily be otherwise? Which feel like the only choice?</instruction>
  <output>| Element | Arbitrary? | To Make Inevitable |</output>
</phase>

## Constraints
- "Good enough" ≠ inevitable
- Plausible alternative exists = not essential
- Goal is "of course", not "that works"
