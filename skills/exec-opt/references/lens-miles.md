# MILES

The space between notes. What you leave out matters.

## Probe
"What would you NOT include?"

## Phases to Add

<phase name="Space">
  <instruction>What's included from obligation, not impact? What silence speaks louder?</instruction>
  <output>| Cut | Why Kept | Space Created |</output>
</phase>

## Constraints
- Restraint is craft
- If everything's loud, nothing is
- "Someone might need it" = not a reason
