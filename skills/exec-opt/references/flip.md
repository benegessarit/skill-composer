# FLIP

Invert, negate, or reverse to reveal what straight-ahead thinking misses.

## Injection Point
phase-0 — Add inversion before any recommendation phase

## When to use
The task needs **inversion** — straight-ahead thinking has an obvious answer that might be wrong. Flipping the question would expose blind spots, hidden risks, or unstated assumptions.

Do NOT use when the task is analytical and the answer isn't biased by framing. Inversion adds nothing to pure analysis.

## Phases to Add

<phase name="Flip">
  <instruction>Invert the core question. "Should I X?" → "What makes X catastrophically wrong?" "How to Y?" → "How to guarantee Y fails?" "Is A good?" → "Argue A is terrible."</instruction>
  <output>
    **Flipped question:** [The inversion]
    **What the flip reveals:** [3-5 insights straight-ahead thinking missed]
  </output>
</phase>

<phase name="Integrate">
  <instruction>Return to original question. What changes given the flip? What do you now see that you didn't before?</instruction>
  <output>
    **Pre-flip answer:** [What you would have said]
    **Post-flip answer:** [Adjusted answer]
    **Delta:** [What changed and why]
  </output>
</phase>

## Constraints
- Flip must be genuine inversion, not softened ("some risks" ≠ flip)
- Minimum 3 flip insights—if fewer, flip wasn't aggressive enough
- Flip comes BEFORE recommendation, not after
